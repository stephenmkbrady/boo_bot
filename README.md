# Boo Bot

This repository contains the `boo_bot` project, a proof-of-concept Matrix chatbot designed to interact with a Matrix homeserver. It uses the `matrix-nio` library for Matrix communication and an external API client (`api_client.py`) for database interactions.

**Note:** This project is currently a development proof of concept and is not production-ready.

## Features

*   **Matrix Homeserver Integration:** Communicates with a Matrix homeserver to send and receive messages.
*   **Database Interaction:** Connects to an external database API for message and media storage.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Built with `asyncio` for efficient handling of I/O-bound tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stephenmkbrady/boo_bot.git
    cd boo_bot
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # For Arch based systems:
    pip install legacy-cgi
    CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 pip install matrix-nio[e2e]
    
    # For every system:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `boo_bot/` directory with your environment variables. An example might include:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:port/database_name"
MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL="https://matrix.example.com"
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN="syt_your_matrix_access_token"
```

### Running the Application


```bash
python boo_bot.py
```

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
